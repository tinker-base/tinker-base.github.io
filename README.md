## Tinker
> Tinker automates the creation of backends for your web applications.

Tinker is an open-source, self-hosted backend-as-a-service (BaaS) that accelerates development speed through automated configuration, deployment, and an intuitive database table editor.

Create public facing backends with minimal configuration in your AWS account through the Tinker CLI. Visualize and modify your application's data and schema with the companion Tinker dashboard.
